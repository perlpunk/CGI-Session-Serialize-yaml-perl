[V 4.24]
Date=2008-11-02T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
* FIX: Remove t/sessiondata/ before creating distro since it is shipped as non-writable
which means testers can't create files in that dir which means they - and I - get failure
reports. Thanx to Andreas J. Koenig for reporting the problem.
That'll teach me to run tests!

[V 4.23]
Date=2008-10-30T00:00:00
Comments=* FIX: Requote the module names in Build.PL and Makefile.PL to keep earlier Perls happy

[V 4.22]
Date=2008-07-22T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
* FIX: Patch Build.PL and Makefile.PL to list all dependencies
and to specify a version of CGI::Session after this code was split out
so installing this module will trigger installation of a version of
CGI::Session without it (this module). See RT#40056.
Reported with suggested patch by Ryan Higgins
* INTERNAL: Rename Changes to Changes.txt to match my other modules
* INTERNAL: Add Changelog.ini

[V 4.21]
Date=2008-03-13T00:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
* NEW: Create separate distro for this module by cutting it out of CGI::Session V 4.21.
The requirement is for CGI::Session V 4.20 to be pre-installed so that you can
install this module on top of CGI::Session without needing to upgrade to V 4.21.
Of course there is no point in that since V 4.20 already includes this module's
code but it allows you to reassure yourself that this distro does install ok
