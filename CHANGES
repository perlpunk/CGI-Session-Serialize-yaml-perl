	- Run dos2unix

4.24 - Sunday, November 2, 2008
	* FIX: Remove t/sessiondata/ before creating distro, since it is shipped as non-writable,
	  which means testers can't create files in that dir, which means they - and I - get failure
	  reports. Thanx to Andreas J. Koenig for reporting the problem.
	  That'll teach me to run tests!

4.23 - Thursday, October 30, 2008
	* FIX: Requote the module names in Build.PL and Makefile.PL to keep earlier Perls happy

4.22 - Tuesday, July 22, 2008
	* FIX:      Patch Build.PL and Makefile.PL to list all dependencies,
	  			and to specify a version of CGI::Session after this code was split out,
				so installing this module will trigger installation of a version of
				CGI::Session without it (this module). See RT#40056.
				Reported, with suggested patch, by Ryan Higgins
    * INTERNAL: Rename Changes to Changes.txt to match my other modules
    * INTERNAL: Add Changelog.ini

4.21 - Thursday, March 13, 2008

    * NEW: Create separate distro for this module by cutting it out of CGI::Session V 4.21.
           The requirement is for CGI::Session V 4.20 to be pre-installed so that you can
           install this module on top of CGI::Session without needing to upgrade to V 4.21.
           Of course there is no point in that, since V 4.20 already includes this module's
           code, but it allows you to reassure yourself that this distro does install ok
